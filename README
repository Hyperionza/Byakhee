Byakhee README
--------------

Greetings, and welcome to the Byakhee Call of Cthulhu character generation program.

Call of Cthulhu is the classic horror roleplaying game of Lovecraftian horror, and 
if you're not familiar with it, I suggest having a look at http://www.chaosium.com/
as a start, or to http://www.yog-sothoth.com/content/ for even more.  It was
originally published some 30 years ago (in 1981) and was designed by Sandy Petersen.

Byakhee's exact origins are lost in time, but I feel comfortable in saying that it 
was created by David Harvey, who continued writing it through several revisions 
through the 3.01 release that he made something of a decade ago, around 1999ish. 
It's a great program for generating Call of Cthulhu characters, but over time his
interest in it waned and it's a happy fact that before he abandoned the project, he
made it open source with the GNU General Public License and uploaded it to 
sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/byakhee/.  All further distribution
of Byakhee is based off of that release, and assumes that he had the legality of
it correct at the time.  His website is gone due to geocities having been 
destroyed by the greater gods, but I seem to have preserved the additional files 
from that project on my webiste.

Currently, John Fiala is taking the project in hand.  It's a little uncertain, 
because he's not that familiar with C++, but we'll see how things go going forward.
The project web-page is now hosted at 
http://www.jcfiala.net/content/byakhee-coc-character-generator, and the project's
source code is now being hosted at https://github.com/jcfiala/Byakhee.

The current plan is to try and update a rules file to handle the new 7th edition.

John Fiala can be contacted through his website, or at jcfiala at gmail dot com.

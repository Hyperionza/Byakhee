//A * in the name will be removed when it's displayed, but it will be sorted before skills
//without one.
//A * at the start of a skill base means it can't be modified. A ^ means it will use the current
//investigator's statistic for the base, multiplied by the number immediately after it. 
//An F before
//the skill causes it to appear in the "Firearms" section of the skill list, rather than with the skills
//The 'extra' column usually contains 0. If it contains more, the skill will have that many subsets, such
//as art: painting or other language: latin etc.
//The era code represents which eras the skill exists in: an  x means it will, a - means it won't

//An occupational skill list is defined as follows:

// if you have an era mask, you can also specify a script
// this is standard Byakhee script and the dice and investigator
